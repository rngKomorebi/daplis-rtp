"""daplis-rtp - Data Analysis Package for LInoSpad, real-time plotting."""

# THE version for this package. CHANGELOG.md is the source of truth for what it
# should be - the newest numbered section there is the current version - and
# this literal must match it. 'tools/check_version.py' enforces that, and CI
# fails the build when they drift.
#
# Declared here rather than in pyproject.toml because pyproject reads it *from*
# here (dynamic version), so there is one place to change, and because the app
# ships as a PyInstaller onefile bundle where importlib.metadata cannot resolve
# an installed distribution.
__version__ = "1.4.0"
