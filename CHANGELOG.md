Flexibility and crash avoidance.

Mask call update.

### Changed

- How the '.txt' files with masks are called. No hard reversing on the path tree, works with every way of installation (manual, from github, pypi, distributable).

Setup-file update.

file.

the package is installed, one can run it via 'daplis-rtp' command.

### Added

- Requirement for the 'qdarkstyle' package for dark-themed GUI.

### Changed

- The 'pyproject.toml' setup file: added a link to the 'main.py' so that
after installation the program can be run via 'daplis-rtp' from the 
terminal/command line.

### Removed

- The '.ui' files since they were changed to '.py'. Also, removed the
back-up copies of the second tab (single pixel histogram) UI.

Minor fixes in all tabs, specifically regarding the canvas widget.

## [0.9.9] - 2025-01-24

Preparing the package for the official release

### Added

- Two boxes for the two top-most pixels (looked for automatically) in 
the live-timestamps tab for easier alignment.

- The single-pixel-histogram tab to match its style to the other
two tabs.

- Unused masks in "params/masks/old".
- Test leftovers in "tests/test_data/results".
