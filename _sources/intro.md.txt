# Introduction

The main purpose of this application is real-time plotting of LinoSPAD2
sensor population for easier handling of the setup. Given the detector 
data acquisition is running and once a path to where data files should
be saved to is set, scripts constantly wait for the latest saved file,
unpack the data, and plot it as a number of timestamps vs. pixel number.
Options for applying masks and calibration of the TDC nonlinearities for
LinoSPAD2 daughterboards A5 and NL11 are provided. Compatible with
firmware versions 2208 and 2212 (both 'block' and 'skip' versions).
Additionally, a real-time masking option is available.

This repo was separated from the [main](https://github.com/rngKomorebi/LinoSPAD2)
library of scripts for LinoSPAD2 data analysis. The reason is that
the app requires its own 'main.py' to run and having it as a standalone
package makes it easy to create an executable with
[pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
