# How to contribute

This repo consists of two branches: 'main' serves as the release version
of the package, tested, and proved to be functional and ready to use, while
the 'develop' branch serves as the main hub for testing new stuff. To
contribute, the best way would be to fork the 'develop' branch and
submit via pull requests. Everyone willing to contribute is kindly asked
to follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and
[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) conventions.
